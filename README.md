* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

Licensing
An open source license details how others can use your code. MIT and GPL are the most common licenses. An MIT license means your code is free to use by anyone and you are not liable (Rails and jQuery use an MIT license). GPL also indicates free usage of the code but when used, the resulting work MUST be open source (Linux, Git and Wordpress use GPL).

For additional details on choosing a license for your code, visit GitHub's Choose a License site.

Expectations
Moving forward, you're expected to include a detailed README.md file for every project you create here at Epicodus. This ensures that anyone who views your portfolios (ie: potential employers!) can quickly understand the concepts you've practiced, and the breadth of apps you've created!

In fact, in level 3 courses all students spend a full day preparing materials for internship interviews, and their future job search. In addition to writing cover letters, preparing a LinkedIn profile, and practicing interview questions, students are also required to ensure all their GitHub repos have detailed READMEs, as seen in this level 3 assignment. Make sure to create a README for each project now, so you don't have to go back and add them all later.
